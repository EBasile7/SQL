#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

-- Superstore Analysis Edward Basile

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
-- order items by price highest to lowest
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC;

#Show a statistic about the item prices.
-- add all prices for the items
SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore;

#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 
-- max price for items in kitchen supplies from highest to lowest
SELECT MAX(price), item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
-- need to the list the name of item highest max price to lowest in kitchen supplies
GROUP by item_name
ORDER BY item_name DESC;

#Come up with your own question about the data and answer it using SQL. 
-- want to know the items where the average rating for the item is 4.5 or greater for each category
SELECT average_rating, category, item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >= 4.5 
AND category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;
-- above selects avg rating for kitchen supplies
-- below selects avg rating for furnishings, needed to use separate queries to get info to display correctly for entire superstore where conditions were met
SELECT average_rating, category, item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >= 4.5 
AND category = 'Furnishings'
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;
-- below selects avg rating for electronics
SELECT average_rating, category, item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >= 4.5 
AND category = 'Electronics'
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;
-- below selects avg rating for appliances
SELECT average_rating, category, item_name
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >= 4.5 
AND category = 'Appliances'
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;
